Insert random numbers, UUIDs, names, IP addresses, and much more using an IntelliJ action.<br />
<br />
To insert random data, press <kbd>Alt + R</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥R</kbd>) to open the list of available templates and choose
one that suits your task.
By default, a different value is inserted at each caret.

<h2>🕸 Data Types</h2>
There are six basic data types that can be inserted and customised:
<ol>
    <li><b>Integers</b>, such as <tt>7,826,922</tt>, from a custom range, in any base from binary to hexatrigesimal.</li>
    <li><b>Decimals</b>, such as <tt>8,816,573.10</tt>, using customisable separators.</li>
    <li><b>Strings</b>, such as <tt>"PaQDQqSBEH"</tt>, with support for reverse regex.</li>
    <li><b>Words</b>, such as <tt>"Bridge"</tt>, with predefined or custom word lists.</li>
    <li><b>UUIDs</b>, such as <tt>0caa7b28-fe58-4ba6-a25a-9e5beaaf8f4b</tt>, with or without dashes.</li>
    <li><b>Date-times</b>, such as <tt>2022-02-03 19:03</tt>, or any other format you want.</li>
</ol>

<h2>🧬 Templates</h2>
For complex kinds of data, you can use templates.
A template is a list of data types that should be concatenated to create random data.
Insert <b>phone numbers</b>, <b>email addresses</b>, <b>URLs</b>, <b>IP addresses</b>, or any <b>custom data type</b>
you can think of.
Of course, Randomness comes bundled with a whole array of predefined templates to help you out.
If needed, you can reuse a template by including it in another template using a <b>reference</b>.

<h2>🗃️ Arrays</h2>
Need a lot of data?
Insert an <b>entire array</b> of any template you want.
For example, an array of integers might look like <tt>[978, 881, 118, 286, 288]</tt>.
You can customise the brackets, delimiter, and number of elements to your liking every time you insert an array,
because no two arrays are the same.

<h2>⌨ Shortcuts</h2>
Instead of using up all your shortcuts, Randomness only uses the <kbd>Alt + R</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥R</kbd>) shortcut by
default.
However, to <b>streamline your workflow</b>, you can assign shortcuts to any template under your IDE's <kbd>Keymap</kbd>
settings.

<h2>💨 Fast insertion</h2>
The insertion popup (shown when you press <kbd>Alt + R</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥R</kbd>) by default) is <b>searchable</b>:
Just type something in the popup and relevant templates will be filtered out.
Or use the <b>hotkeys</b> that are assigned to the first 10 templates in the list:
Press any digit to directly insert the corresponding template.
<b>Reorder templates</b> in the settings menu to change which template uses which hotkey.

<h2>👀 Previews</h2>
To <b>help you decide</b> what settings to choose, a preview of the template is shown while you're editing.
