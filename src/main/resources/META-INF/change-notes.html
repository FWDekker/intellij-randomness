<b>Welcome to Randomness 3!</b>
<p>
    This release brings a major overhaul of how data is generated, allowing you to create your own data types such as
    IP addresses or entire JSON objects.
    At the same time, it remains just as easy to generate plain numbers.
    Check the plugin description for more details and animated usage examples.

<b>Breaking changes</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        Minimum IDE version has been increased to 2021.2.
    </li>
    <li>
        Randomness now uses templates to generate data.
        A template consists of a list of "primitive" data types which are concatenated together.
        Data types include the old data types (integer, decimal, string, word, UUID), but also the new date-time, and
        the template reference.
    </li>
    <li>
        Strings no longer consist of customisable symbol sets, but are specified using a regex.
    </li>
    <li>
        Words are no longer read from dictionary files, but are stored directly in the settings window.
        To reuse words in multiple templates, consider using template references.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>New features</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        In addition to a list of standard separators, you can now also choose your own separator for all data types,
        including for arrays.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each time you insert an array your demands will be slightly different, so when you insert an array a dialog is
        shown in which you can quickly vary the array's settings.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can automatically pad (or truncate) integers to a specific length.
    </li>
    <li>
        Icons for templates and data types are dynamically generated based on the involved data types.
    </li>
    <li>
        The preview pane now looks more beautiful :-)
    </li>
    <li>
        Invalid settings are now easier to correct with more specific error messages.
    </li>
    <li>
        All strings have been internationalised, to make future translation easier.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Fixes</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        The settings-only popup is now also shown when editing a read-only file.
    </li>
</ul>
