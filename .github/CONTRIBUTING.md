## 🔨 Submit a pull request
Whether you're adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or fixing a typo in documentation, the following guidelines will help
you on your way to submitting a good pull request.
Pull requests that do not meet the following guidelines are **fine**; these are just guidelines after all.

### 📚 Documentation
Always update related documentation, both code documentation and user instructions such as the [README](../README.md).
Additionally, make sure you update the [change notes](../src/main/resources/META-INF/change-notes.html) if necessary.

### 🧪 Tests
If you fixed a bug or added a new feature, make sure you add tests that cover this.
If you need help writing tests you can open a pull request with your work in progress and ask for help there.

Always run tests and static analysis before opening a pull request.

### 🗃️ Coding conventions
This project maintains the [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html).
[Detekt](https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt/) will, amongst others, check these coding conventions.
Check the [README](../README.md) for instructions on using tools such as Detekt.

Additionally, please make sure you write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
