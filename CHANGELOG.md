## 3.0.0 -- 2023-11-17
This release brings a major overhaul of how data is generated, allowing you to create your own data types such as IP
addresses or entire JSON objects.
At the same time, it remains just as easy to generate plain numbers.
Check the plugin description for more details and animated usage examples.

### Added
* Each time you insert an array your demands will be slightly different, so when you insert an array a dialog is shown
  in which you can quickly vary the array's settings.
* In addition to a list of standard separators, you can now also choose your own separator for all data types, including
  for arrays.
* You can automatically pad (or truncate) integers to a specific length.
* A notification is shown after upgrading to Randomness 3 to inform the user of incompatibilities with settings from
  older versions.
* Future backwards compatibility ensures that your settings can always be imported into future versions.

### Changed
* Randomness now uses templates to generate data.
  A template consists of a list of "primitive" data types which are concatenated together.
  Data types include the old data types (integer, decimal, string, word, UUID), but also the new date-time and the
  template reference.
* Strings no longer consist of customisable symbol sets, but are specified using a regex.
* Words are no longer read from dictionary files, but are stored directly in the settings window. To reuse words in
  multiple templates, consider using template references.
* The preview pane now looks more beautiful :-)
* Icons for templates and data types are dynamically generated based on the involved data types.
* Invalid settings are now easier to correct with more specific error messages.
* All strings have been internationalised, to make future translation easier.
* Changelogs are now kept in [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) style.

### Deprecated
* Minimum IDE version has been increased to 2022.3.

### Fixed
* The settings-only popup is now also shown when editing a read-only file.
