<br />
Rather than going to [random.org](https://www.random.org/) or making up your own random data, you can now insert random data using an IntelliJ action!

This plugin is also available on the [plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9836-randomness).

Note that the generated values are **not** cryptographically safe.


## How to use
To insert random data, press `Ctrl + Alt + R` (or `⌘⌥R`) and choose the type of data you want to insert.
