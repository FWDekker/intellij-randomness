Rather than going to [random.org](https://www.random.org/) or making up your own random data, you can now insert random numbers, UUIDs, names, IP addresses, and much more using an IntelliJ action!

This plugin is also available on the [plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9836-randomness)!


## 📖 How to use
To insert random data, press <kbd>Alt + R</kbd> (<kbd>or ⌥R</kbd>) to open the list of available templates and choose one that suits your task.
By default, a different value is inserted at each caret.

You can modify this behavior by holding a key while selecting the type of data to insert:
* **Array**: Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to insert a customisable array of values.
* **Repeat**: Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥</kbd>) to insert the same value at each caret.
* **Settings**: Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to open the settings of that data type.

You can hold multiple modifier keys to combine their effects.

Randomness can also be found in the main menu under <kbd>Tools</kbd> and under <kbd>Code > Generate</kbd>.

## ✨ Features
* 🕸 **Data Types**<br />
  There are six basic data types that can be inserted and customised:
    1. **Integers**, such as `7,826,922`, from a custom range, in any base from binary to hexatrigesimal.
    2. **Decimals**, such as `8,816,573.10`, using customisable separators.
    3. **Strings**, such as `"PaQDQqSBEH"`, with support for reverse regex.
    4. **Words**, such as `"Bridge"`, with predefined or custom word lists.
    5. **UUIDs**, such as `0caa7b28-fe58-4ba6-a25a-9e5beaaf8f4b`, with or without dashes.
    6. **Nano IDs**, such as `V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B-myT`, with customisable alphabets and sizes.
    7. **Date-times**, such as `2022-02-03 19:03`, or any other format you want.
* 🧬 **Templates**<br />
  For complex kinds of data, you can use templates.
  A template is a list of data types that should be concatenated to create random data.
  Insert **phone numbers**, **email addresses**, **URLs**, **IP addresses**, or any **custom data type** you can think of.
  Of course, Randomness comes bundled with a multitude of predefined templates to help you out.
  To help you save time, you can also include templates inside other templates using **references**.

  <img width="450px" src=".github/img/configuration-sample.gif" alt="Animation of how to configure templates" />
* 🗃️ **Arrays**<br />
  Need a lot of data?
  Insert an **entire array** of any template you want.
  For example, an array of integers might look like `[978, 881, 118, 286, 288]` or `{0: "dog", 1: "giraffe", 2: "mouse"}`.
  You can customise the brackets, delimiter, element format, and number of elements to your liking every time you insert an array, because no two arrays are the same.

  <img width="450px" src=".github/img/array-insertion-sample.gif" alt="Animation of how to insert arrays" />
* ⌨️ **Shortcuts**<br />
  Instead of using up all your shortcuts, Randomness only uses the <kbd>Alt + R</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥R</kbd>) shortcut by default.
  However, to **streamline your workflow**, you can assign shortcuts to any template under your IDE's <kbd>Keymap</kbd> settings.

  <img width="450px" src=".github/img/shortcuts.png" alt="Shortcut settings for Randomness" />
* 💨 **Fast insertion**<br />
  The insertion popup (shown when you press <kbd>Alt + R</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥R</kbd>) by default) is **searchable**:
  Just type something in the popup and relevant templates will be filtered out.
  Or use the **hotkeys** that are assigned to the first 10 templates in the list:
  Press any digit to directly insert the corresponding template.
  **Reorder templates** in the settings menu to change which template uses which hotkey.

* 👀 **Previews**<br />
  To **help you decide** what settings to choose, a preview of the template is shown while you're editing.

## 💻 Development
This section contains instructions in case you want to build the plugin from source or want to help with development.
Please also check the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### 🔨 Build/run
```bash
$ gradlew runIde                       # Open a sandbox IntelliJ instance running the plugin
$ gradlew buildPlugin                  # Build an installable zip of the plugin
$ gradlew buildPlugin -Pbuild.hotswap  # Same as above, but allow hot-swapping the plugin during development
$ gradlew signPlugin                   # Build and sign plugin
```

Signing the plugin requires specific environment variables to be set to refer to appropriate key files.
See [Plugin Signing](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/plugin-signing.html) for more information.

### 🧪 Quality assurance
```bash
$ gradlew test                    # Run tests (and collect coverage)
$ gradlew test --tests X          # Run tests in class X (package name optional)
$ gradlew test -Pkotest.tags="X"  # Run tests matching tag(s) X (also supports not (!), and (&), or (|))
$ gradlew koverHtmlReport         # Create HTML coverage report for previous test run
$ gradlew detekt                  # Run static analysis
$ gradlew check                   # Run all tests and static analysis
$ gradlew verifyPlugin            # Check for compatibility issues
```

#### 🏷️ Tagging and filtering tests
[Kotest tests can be tagged](https://kotest.io/docs/framework/tags.html) to allow selectively running tests.
Simply run Gradle with argument `-Pkotest.tags="X"` to run only tests tagged with tag `X`.
The tags for Randomness are statically defined in [`Tags`](https://github.com/fwdekker/intellij-randomness/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/com/fwdekker/randomness/testhelpers/Tags.kt).
If you want to debug a test, you can tag it with the `Focus` tag to ensure only those tests run.
Alternatively, prefix the description with the string `f:`.
Make sure you remove the tag afterwards!

You can tag an entire test class by adding `tags(...)` to the class definition, or tag an individual test `context` by writing `context("foo").config(tags = setOf(...)) {`.
Due to limitations in Kotest, you can only tag the outer level of `context`s; you cannot tag a nested `context` or an individual `test`.
This is also true for prefixing with `f:`.

### 📚 Documentation
```bash
$ gradlew dokkaGenerateHtml                        # Generate documentation
$ gradlew dokkaGenerateHtml -Pdokka.pagesDir=/foo  # Generate documentation, and link to older versions in `/foo`
```

Documentation pages link to each other using a version dropdown menu.
Simply running `gradlew dokkaGenerateHtml` does not generate a dropdown menu, because Dokka is not automatically aware of all previous versions.
To link the versions together, check out the `gh-branch` of this repository in a separate directory, and point `dokka.pagesDir` to that directory.

### 📯 Release
To create a release, manually trigger the [deployment workflow](https://github.com/fwdekker/intellij-randomness/actions/workflows/cd.yml) on the `main` branch.
This workflow will do the following:
1. Run a few sanity checks.
2. Build and sign the plugin.
3. Upload the plugin to the JetBrains Marketplace.
4. Create a GitHub release.
5. Update [GitHub Pages](https://fwdekker.github.io/intellij-randomness/).

### 🖼 Icons
The icons used by the plugin are found in [the file `icons.sketch`](.github/img/icons.sketch).
You can open this file with [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) (macOS), [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) (Windows), or [Figma](https://github.com/Figma-Linux/figma-linux) (Linux).
