# This README is about the upcoming v3 release. For information about the latest public version, [check the old README](https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/tree/v2)

Rather than going to [random.org](https://www.random.org/) or making up your own random data, you can now insert random
numbers, UUIDs, names, IP addresses, and much more using an IntelliJ action!

This plugin is also available on the [plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9836-randomness)!


## 📖 How to use
To insert random data, press <kbd>Alt + R</kbd> (<kbd>or ⌥R</kbd>) to open the list of available templates and choose
one that suits your task.
By default, a different value is inserted at each caret.

You can modify this behavior by holding a key while selecting the type of data to insert:
* **Array**: Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to insert a customisable array of values.
* **Repeat**: Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥</kbd>) to insert the same value at each caret.
* **Settings**: Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to open the settings of that data type.

You can hold multiple modifier keys to combine their effects.

Randomness can also be found in the main menu under <kbd>Tools</kbd> or in <kbd>Code > Generate</kbd>.

## ✨ Features
* 🕸 **Data Types**<br />
  There are six basic data types that can be inserted and customised:
    1. **Integers**, such as `7,826,922`, from a custom range, in any base from binary to hexatrigesimal.
    2. **Decimals**, such as `8,816,573.10`, using customisable separators.
    3. **Strings**, such as `"PaQDQqSBEH"`, specified using a regex.
    4. **Words**, such as `"Bridge"`, with predefined or custom word lists.
    5. **UUIDs**, such as `0caa7b28-fe58-4ba6-a25a-9e5beaaf8f4b`, with or without dashes.
    6. **Date-times**, such as `2022-02-03 19:03`, or any other format you want.
* 🧬 **Templates**<br />
  For complex kinds of data, you can use templates.
  A template is a list of data types that should be concatenated to create random data.
  Insert **phone numbers**, **email addresses**, **URLs**, **IP addresses**, or any **custom data type** you can think
  of.
  Of course, Randomness comes bundled with a whole array of predefined templates to help you out.
  If needed, you can reuse a template by including it in another template using a **reference**.

  <img width="450px" src=".github/img/configuration-sample.gif" alt="Animation of how to configure templates" />
* 🗃️ **Arrays**<br />
  Need a lot of data?
  Insert **an entire array** of any template you want.
  For example, an array of integers might look like `[978, 881, 118, 286, 288]`.
  You can customise the brackets, delimiter, and number of elements to your liking every time you insert an array,
  because no two arrays are the same.

  <img width="450px" src=".github/img/array-insertion-sample.gif" alt="Animation of how to insert arrays" />
* ⌨️ **Shortcuts**<br />
  Instead of using up all your shortcuts, Randomness only uses the <kbd>Alt + R</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥R</kbd>) shortcut by
  default.
  However, to **streamline your workflow**, you can assign shortcuts to any template under your IDE's <kbd>Keymap</kbd>
  settings.

* 💨 **Fast insertion**<br />
  The insertion popup (shown when you press <kbd>Alt + R</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥R</kbd>) by default) is **searchable**:
  Just type something in the popup and relevant templates will be filtered out.
  Or use the **hotkeys** that are assigned to the first 10 templates in the list:
  Press any digit to directly insert the corresponding template.
  **Reorder templates** in the settings menu to change which template uses which hotkey.

* 👀 **Previews**<br />
  To **help you decide** what settings to choose, a preview of the template is shown while you're editing.
